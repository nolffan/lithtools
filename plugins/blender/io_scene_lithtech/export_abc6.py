"""Export an armature and its meshes as LithTech 1's .abc version 6 (Shogo,
Blood 2, KISS Psycho Circus), vertex animation included.

The inverse of import_abc for a v6 file. Every value is worked out from the
scene; where it still agrees with what the importer kept (the lt_v6_*
properties and attributes, see import_abc._keep_v6), the kept value is
written instead, exactly, as export_abc does for lt_location and the key
strings. So a v6 model imported and not edited is written back byte for
byte, and an edit changes only what it touches.

What v6 holds, and where it comes from:
  * ONE mesh, each vertex on ONE node, in that node's space at the first
    pose. The meshes the armature deforms (export_abc's rule) are written
    as one, in order. A vertex weighted to several bones goes to the
    heaviest; one with none to the bone its object is parented to, else
    the root. Triangles only.
  * the bones, numbered as export_abc numbers them.
  * the actions, found and keyed as export_abc finds and keys them. LithTech
    1 has no separate bind pose: it is the FIRST key of the FIRST
    animation, so that key should be the armature's rest pose (the
    importer makes it so) or the mesh comes out bent.
  * VERTEX ANIMATION: the mesh's shape keys "<action>|<key>"
    (import_abc.shape_key_name), at the bind pose, for each node's
    "animated vertices". A node keeps the list it was imported with while
    the mesh's faces are unchanged; a node with a vertex that moves in any
    frame lists every vertex on it, as every such node in the shipped files
    does. Each frame is stored as three bytes
    per vertex, byte * scale + translation in the node's space: the kept
    scale and translation while every byte still fits, else new ones that
    span the frames.
  * bounds (the model's, each node's, each animation's and keyframe's): the
    kept ones while what they bound is unchanged, else worked out by the
    rule most shipped files follow (measured on Shogo's and Blood 2's
    demos: the posed vertices' box for a keyframe, 637 of 749; the first
    pose's for the model, 185 of 200; the keyframes' union for an
    animation, 139 of 215; a node's own vertices for a node, 1,317 of
    1,320).
  * the reduced-detail vertices, which Blender doesn't show: kept while the
    mesh's faces and vertex count are unchanged (they refer to its vertices
    by number), else dropped (NumLODs 0, as 326 of the 414 v6 models held
    ship), and the vertices' LOD replacements with them.

Skins are not written: LithTech 1's textures are not the DTX version
textures.save_image writes.
