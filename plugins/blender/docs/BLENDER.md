# The Blender extension

`io_scene_lithtech` imports and exports LithTech models (`.abc` versions 9
to 12: NOLF, AvP2; `.ltb` model file versions 18 to 25: NOLF2, Contract
J.A.C.K., Tron 2.0) and textures (`.dtx`, version -5) in Blender 5.2 LTS
and later.

## Installing

Build the package and install it (or drag the zip onto Blender):

```
blender --command extension build --source-dir io_scene_lithtech --output-dir dist
blender --command extension install-file -r user_default -e dist/io_scene_lithtech-0.1.0.zip
```

Then use **File > Import / Export > LithTech Model (.abc)** and **LithTech
Texture (.dtx)**, or drop an `.abc` onto the viewport. In the Image Editor,
**Image > Open / Save as LithTech Texture** does the same for textures.

## Models

| LithTech | Blender |
|---|---|
| node tree | armature; one bone per node, at its bind matrix |
| piece | mesh object parented to the armature, with an Armature modifier |
| vertex weights | vertex groups named after the bones |
| UVs (one per triangle corner) | the `UVMap` layer |
| vertex normals | custom normals |
| LODs 1..n | hidden objects `<piece>_LOD<n>` in a `<model> LODs` collection |
| skin slot | material `<model>_skin<n>`, with the DTX if one was found |
| sockets | arrow empties parented to their node's bone |
| animations | actions (fake user), linear keys at the stored times |
| keyframe strings | the action's pose markers |
| child models' animations | actions too, marked `lt_child` (not exported) |

**Space.** LithTech is left-handed with Y up and models face +Z. The
importer swaps Y and Z (which also fixes the handedness and turns the
triangle winding round), so models stand on Blender's Z up and face +Y.
*Face Front* (on by default) turns the armature object 180° to face -Y, as
Blender's front view expects. The exporter writes the model in the
armature's own space, so the object's transform never reaches the file.

**Scale.** LithTech units have no fixed size; a NOLF character is about
100 units tall. Import *Scale* is Blender units per LithTech unit (0.018
gives a 1.8 m character); export *Scale* is the inverse and defaults to
undo whatever the model was imported at.

**Skins.** The file names no textures: the game's attribute files pick
them. The importer looks for `SKINS/<model>.dtx` beside the `MODELS`
directory (NOLF and AvP2 keep `CHARS/MODELS/X.abc` with
`CHARS/SKINS/X.dtx`), then `<model>_*.dtx` for the other slots, in the
model's directory and in *Skin Directory*. A wrong match is fixed by
picking another image in the material.

**Alpha.** Skins often use alpha as a mask, or leave it at 0, so the image
keeps it (`Channel Packed`) without making the material see-through.

### What is kept for export

LithTech data with no place in Blender is kept as custom properties, all
named `lt_*`:

- armature object: `lt_version`, `lt_command_string` (the model's command
  string: shadows, `NormalRef` and so on), `lt_internal_radius`,
  `lt_lod_distances`, `lt_scale`, `lt_save_index`, and JSON for the weight
  sets, the child models and their animation bindings;
- bones: `lt_index` (the order nodes are written in) and `lt_flags`;
- piece objects: `lt_piece`, `lt_piece_index`, `lt_lod`,
  `lt_texture_index`, `lt_specular_power`, `lt_specular_scale`,
  `lt_lod_weight`;
- actions: `lt_dims` (the box), `lt_translation`, `lt_interpolation_ms`,
  `lt_weight_set`, `lt_index`, and the keyframe strings exactly (pose
  marker names stop at 63 bytes and sit on whole frames);
- meshes: `lt_replacement` (each vertex's collapse target), `lt_normal`
  (the stored normals, since Blender keeps custom normals only to about
  1e-3 and can't hold a zero one) and `lt_import_normal` (the corner
  normals at import, so the exporter can tell which ones were edited).
  Vertices whose weights don't follow from their position (some LODs, and
  biases that don't sum to 1 or name a node twice) also keep their stored
  weights while they stay where they were.

Everything has a default, so models made in Blender export as well: any
mesh deformed by the armature is a piece (one per material), vertex groups
named after bones are the weights, empties on bones are sockets, and every
action that animates the bones is an animation, keyed wherever any of its
F-curves has a key. With no actions the model gets one animation, `base`,
at the rest pose.

### Round trip

`tests/blender_roundtrip.py` imports every shipped model (754: NOLF GOTY
and AvP2 Primal Hunt), exports it and compares the two field by field. All
754 pass. Names, counts, flags, indices, triangles, weights, keyframe
times and strings, and the header data match exactly. Numbers match within
float precision (the worst cases are 6e-5 units in animation positions and
5e-5 in bone rotations, from Blender's bone matrices).

The exported file isn't byte-identical to the shipped one: it is rebuilt
from Blender's data, so floats differ in their last bits, and the original
order of each vertex's weights isn't kept (they're written by node).

## Textures

An imported DTX becomes a packed image with its header settings as custom
properties (`lt_bpp`, `lt_user_flags`, `lt_command`, `lt_texture_group`,
`lt_mipmaps_to_use`, `lt_mip_count`, `lt_priority`, `lt_detail_*`, and
sections such as `LIGHTDEFS`). Exporting writes those settings back.
*Format* picks 32-bit (lossless) or DXT1/3/5. The DXT encoder is a simple
one, not the original tools', so re-encoding a shipped DXT texture changes
its bytes slightly (2-3 levels per channel on average). Images must be
powers of two.

Cube maps import as their first face, and export as a flat texture.

The image also keeps the file it came from (`lt_dtx`) and a digest of its
pixels (`lt_pixels`). Exported unchanged with *Format* "As Imported", it
writes that file back byte for byte, so a DXT texture that was only looked
at keeps its exact bytes.

**PS2 textures** (32P: 256 colors, from the PS2 version of NOLF) import
with their palette alpha read as the PS2 draws it (0x80 is opaque; the
*Palette Alpha* import option is Auto, PS2 or Stored) and export back to
32P (*Format* "32P (PS2)" turns any image into one). An edited image that
still only uses its palette's colors keeps that palette; otherwise it is
quantised to 256 colors again, with three mips as DEdit made them. See
`DTX.md`, "PS2 textures".

## LTB models (NOLF2, Contract J.A.C.K., Tron 2.0)

**File > Import / Export > LithTech Model (.ltb)**, or drop an `.ltb` on
the viewport. The layout in Blender is the `.abc` one (armature, a mesh per
piece, hidden LOD objects, socket empties, actions); `docs/LTB.md` has the
format. What `.ltb` adds:

| LTB | Blender |
|---|---|
| a LOD's D3D vertices | the mesh's vertices, in their stored order (UV seams are split vertices, as the game draws them) |
| bone sets (up to four nodes for a run of vertices) | vertex groups; the sets themselves in `lt_bone_sets` |
| rigid and vertex-animated meshes | weighted wholly to their node (`lt_bone_effector`) |
| vertex animation frames | shape keys `<animation>\|<key>` |
| a LOD's skins, render style, priority | `lt_textures`, `lt_texture_count`, `lt_render_style`, `lt_render_priority` |
| animation compression | `lt_compression` (0 none, 1 relevant keys, 2 16-bit, 3 16-bit rotations) |

**Skins.** In an extracted game tree the importer reads
`ATTRIBUTES/MODELBUTES.TXT`, finds the model by its `ModelFile` and uses its
`Skin0..N` (NOLF2's `player_action.ltb` gets `CateAction`, `CateCasualHead`
and `CateCasualHair`); elsewhere it guesses as for `.abc`.

**Export.** A mesh imported from an `.ltb` whose vertex and face counts
haven't changed keeps its D3D layout (vertex order, bone sets, the blend
weights where unchanged); any other mesh is laid out afresh: one D3D vertex
per distinct vertex and UV, rigid if one bone (or none) deforms it, else
skeletal with its triangles packed into bone sets of up to four bones (the
strongest four per triangle). Animations keep their compression and the
number of keys each channel had; new ones are written with 16-bit
rotations (the most common kind) and a key per keyframe where a channel
changes. The model file version is the imported one, else 23, which every
shipped engine loads (*Version* chooses).

Data Blender can't hold is kept for the export as well: keys that share a
time (an F-curve can't key a frame twice), non-unit quaternions (some
sockets and animations), bind matrices with scale, UVs of vertices no face
uses, the stored normals and blend weights.

**Round trip.** `tests/blender_roundtrip_ltb.py` imports, exports and
compares every distinct shipped model: 2,273 (NOLF2, Contract J.A.C.K.,
Tron 2.0 and the tools' and Jupiter builds' samples), all within float
precision: positions within 0.001 units, rotations within 2e-7, and
everything else exact, the allocation counts the engine sizes its memory
by included. The 31 chunked files from before the format settled (the
games can't load them) are read and written back but not imported.

## Not yet

- Shogo/Blood 2-era `.abc` (its own module beside `lithtech/abc.py`).
- Matrix-palette skeletal meshes are read and written but no shipped model
  uses them, so they're untested.
- World files (`.dat`).
- Reading the attribute files of NOLF and AvP2 to pick `.abc` skins (`.ltb` models already use MODELBUTES.TXT).
