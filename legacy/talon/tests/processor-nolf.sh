# Processor.exe (NOLF): every sample world of the NOLF Tools 001, processed
# by the shipped exe and by ours, with DEdit's default options and with
# lighting and full visibility, must give byte-identical .dat files.
#
# NOLF's processor differs from AvP2's in how it is run: it takes the world
# without its .ed (it adds that), and it takes no options on its command
# line, only from the first line of processor.opt in its working directory
# (DEdit writes it), -skipdialog included. It never exits by itself: the
# progress dialog stays up when it is done, so each run is stopped once the
# log (-logfile) has its last line. The worlds come from NOLFTOOLS001.REZ.
